# CPSC-323-Group-Compiler
Group Project for CPSC 323

## Progress
**03-05-2018:** 
Created compiler.c which determines if we are in a comment. 
Added the final.txt and abc13.cpp from the project specification.
Was able to get excess space, excess newlines and comments removed from text.
Next step is to adjust spacing around variabes.
